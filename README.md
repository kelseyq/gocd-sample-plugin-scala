GoCD Sample Plugin in Scala
===========================

This is a Scala/SBT port of the curl [sample plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/tree/master/plugin-infra/sample-plugins) for [GoCD](http://www.go.cd/). To install, run `sbt clean assembly` in the plugin folder, and copy the resulting jar (in target/scala-2.10/) to the appropriate place on your Go server. Yeah, it's a big file--live a little!
